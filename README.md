# axion_economy
Stats site for Axion v1

Depreciated and all mongo keys deactivated since Axion is now on v3, and the contracts have changed significantly.

P.s: I know never to store secret information in the codebase, but this was a private repo only I ever had access to and never planned to make the repo public. Only reason I did is to show my work to potential employers and because this site is no longer used/live. All keys have been deactivated before publishing.
